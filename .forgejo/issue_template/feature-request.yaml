      - Please speak English, as this is the language all maintainers can speak and write.
      - Be as clear and concise as possible. A very verbose request is harder to interpret in a concrete way.
      - Be civil, and follow the [Forgejo Code of Conduct](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/code-of-conduct).
      - Please make sure you are using the latest release of the runner and take a moment to [check that your feature hasn't already been suggested](https://code.forgejo.org/forgejo/runner/issues?q=&type=all).
